This repository contains chef recipes that I use in my daily work, all of them have been tested in ubuntu 8.04 and ubuntu 8.10. 
Recipes provide emphasis on supporting [Brightbox platform](http://wiki.brightbox.co.uk/) and [Brightbox public Ubuntu repositories](http://wiki.brightbox.co.uk/docs:brightboxaptrepository). 
Some code is borrowed from [Oopscode](http://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/) and [37 Signals](http://github.com/37signals/37s_cookbooks) cookbooks.
If you are sucessfully using this recipes in other platforms, please let me know.
Also, if you are using this recipes and find a bug, improvement or have some feature request, please sent me an [email](jacobo.garcia@gmail.com).
